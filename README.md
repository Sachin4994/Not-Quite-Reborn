# Not-Quite-Reborn
This is the code for Not Quite Reborn AKA NQR which is a discord bot for the game Pokemon Revolution Online.

This was my first programming project so the code may be really unbearable.(Especially my choice of variable names)
Angreifer helped me alot in the project and created some of the only decent commands you can find in the bot.

You may use any part of this project in your own project. Make sure to change the Token at the end of the main.py file to your own discord bot's token to start the bot as your own bot.
I have Reworked the commands to Slash commands already and they may take upto 2 hours to initialize in all servers.
There may or may not be early versions of code commented or unused in other files.

You may contact me at my discord Sachin#8011 if you have any questions or need any help regarding the discord bot.

NOTE: I only know python so do not contact me if you want me to help regarding any other language, also please have at least basic knowledge of python.
